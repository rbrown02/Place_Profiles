## What we will cover {.smaller}

<br>
This presentation will demonstrate how you can harness the FingertipsR package to produce a Shiny dashboard summarquartoising key metrics. We will discuss:
<br><br>

-  The brief
-  What did we do and why?
-  Quick demo of dashboard
-  What issues we encountered
-  Future developments

## Brief {.smaller}
<br>

To create an overview for individual ICBs summarising published public health data - mainly from Fingertips. The metrics of interest included:
<br><br>

|                                            |                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| <i class="fas fa-users icon-demographics"></i>    Population demographics | <i class="fas fa-heartbeat icon-life-expectancy"></i>    Life expectancy |
| <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap icon-education"></i>    Education & employment | <i class="fas fa-home icon-household"></i>    Household metrics |
| <i class="fas fa-dumbbell icon-dumbell"></i>    Physical activity & obesity | <i class="fas fa-smoking icon-smoking"></i>    Smoking & other risk factors |




## Our Solution {.smaller}
<br>

Using the [FingertipsR package](https://github.com/ropensci/fingertipsR/tree/master), developed by PHE, to load Fingertips data into R data frames.

<br>

#### Presentation options:

<br>

| Method  | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|------|:---------|:----------|
| Quarto      | Quickly generate polished PDF/HTML reports   |  Static reports - need to re-generate and re-share |
| Shiny Dashboard    | Interactive with live data refresh through API  |   Easy customisation limited by Shiny default layouts & hosting requirement |

## Problems we encountered

<br>

|        |                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
|<i class="fas fa-globe icon-map"></i> | Using Local Authorities (LAs) not ICBs |
|<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle icon-break"></i> | LA boundaries changes can lead to missing data|
|<i class="fas fa-calendar icon-calendar"></i> | Inconsistent reporting periods|
|<i class="fas fa-clock icon-clock"></i> | Time constraints using free version of Shiny.io|


## Future Developments {.smaller}
<br>

- Option to look at ICB data where available
<br><br>

- Adding in different publically available data. E.g.
    - Ofcom - Digital Exclusion 
    - OS - Open Greenspace
<br><br>

- Combining with another Shiny dahsboard which webscrapes NHSE's data (A&E, RTT, ambulance performance).

## Acknowledgements & Resources {.smaller}

I would like to thank Ben Murch for support in developing this dashboard and helping with the presentation. Clare Thompson also reviewed the code and fixed a lot of issues so big thank you to her!
<br><br>

Also thanks to HSMA (Dan & Sammi) without whom you would be reading this as a PowerPoint and not a cool Quarto presentation!
